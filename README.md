#  **Zombie Knights**
This is a classic Zombie Knights game written in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to shoot down waves of zombies and to survive a zombie apocalypse.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The fonts, images and audios used in the program

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 zombie_knight.py

## **How to Play**
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player left and right, press the space bar to jump, and the up arrow key to shoot.
2. Kill all the zombies to earn points and regain health. After shooting a zombie, you can kill it by colliding with it. Additionally, a ruby will appear on the screen after killing a zombie, which you can catch to increase your score.
3. Keep an eye out for portals, which can transport you from one side of the screen to the other. Use them strategically to catch as many zombies as possible and increase your score.
4. The game features different rounds, with increasing difficulty as you progress. The zombies move faster and are harder to shoot down in later rounds.
5. If a zombie collides with you, you will lose some health. Keep an eye on your health bar at the bottom of the screen.
6. If you lose all your health, the game is over. Try to survive as long as possible and beat your high score!

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Change the graphics: You can replace the graphics with your own images or find new ones online. You can also change the colors and fonts used in the game.
2. Adjust the difficulty: You can modify the difficulty by changing the speed of the zombies.
3. Add power-ups: You can add power-ups to the game that give the player extra lives, faster bullets, or other advantages.
4. Add multiplayer: You can add a multiplayer mode where two players compete against each other to see who can defeat the zombies first.
